# Just Some Windows

A project using HTML and CSS to create windows. Contributions welcome!

## Types of Windows
You can choose from:
- A hanging window
- A regular window

## HTML
The HTML is rather simple. It's just a 2x2 table with borders and a transparent background.

## CSS
The CSS involves a `backdrop-filter` property (or in the case of the regular window, a `filter` property) blurring the area behind the window.

Other than that, the code just center-aligns it, adds a rope (in the case of the hanging window), etc.

## JS
The JS is just 25 lines that randomly may make the window blow away and make the user reload the game.
